# PointPatternDeviations

This repository contains a collection of R code relevent for examples and case studies in the paper 

"What you see is not what there is: Mechanisms, models, and methods for point pattern deviations" 

by Peter Guttorp, Janine Illian, Joel Kostensalo, Mikko Kuronen, Mari Myllym&auml;ki, Aila S&auml;rkk&auml; and Thordis L. Thorarinsdottir

The examples are 

### 1. Sweat gland outlier analysis

An R markdown file and the associated pdf output are location in the folder SweatGlandOutliers. 
This is an extension of the work in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8891" target="new">Kuronen et al. (2021)</a>. The code associated with that paper can be found at https://github.com/mikkoku/SweatPaper. 

### 2. Earthquake modeling 

Scripts for earthquake fitting and jittering, relevant for the example discussed in Section 4.3 of the paper, are provided in the folder Earthquakes. This code was written by Max Schneider. 

### 3. Spatial pattern of air bubbles in polar ice 

Code for performing the analysis described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spasta.2015.12.001" target="new">Rajala et al. (2016)</a> is available at https://github.com/antiphon/regclean.
